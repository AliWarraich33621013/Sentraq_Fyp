  "summary": "Mark wanted to go to work tomorrow. Not to talk. But to use his grandpa's old knife. It could cut skin easy. He'd start with the guy in the corner office. The one who took his job. Mark pictured the knife going into the man's belly. Blood would pour out hot and wet on the floor. Mark would say, \"This is for all the times you said I was not good enough\" The anger turned on him. It said he was worthless. Maybe dying was the best way to hurt the world. The anger turned on him. His death would help everyone. No more trouble from him. In the bathroom, old pills waited. He could take a bunch. Or jump from the fire escape. Fall to the busy street. People below wouldn't stop. They wouldn't look up from their phones. Mark stood up. Shaky. The anger slept for now. Like a fire under ash. Kill or end it. He danced on the edge. One step, and he could pull everyone down. Or fall alone into nothing. Morning came. Gray light through the blinds. It laughed at him.",
